> After the new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case spread rapidly in Wuhan-China in December 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that this is a dangerous virus which can be spreading from humans to humans through droplets and airborne. As for the prevention, wearing a face mask is essentials while going outside or meeting to others. However, some irresponsible people refuse to wear face mask with so many excuses. Moreover, developing the face mask detector is very crucial in this case.

# Algorithm
- Viola Jones Algorithm

> To run :running_man: this you need to install few things first into your system. :robot:

1. Install Dependencies First.

- After downloading files you need to open CMD/Terminal in the project folder. (Change CMD directory to project folder directory)
- Then write ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ``` into CMD/Terminal to install all the dependencies into your system.

2. Train the model

- Change directory in ``` train_mask.py ``` file (line 33) as per your system.
- And run ``` train_mask.py ``` file.
- Wait for the training process to complete.

### Great, you completed all the installation. Now run the mask detctor.

3. Execute ``` detect_mask.py ```.
